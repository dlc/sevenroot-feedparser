This morning we found out that Jorge Adkins, a 22 year old suffering from brain cancer, passed away on Sunday. He was a fan of Zelda, and of all the images in the world he could have used to represent his love for the series, he chose our own. It is an honor to know that something we created was used in the final words of goodbye a fellow Zelda fan gave to the online world. Rest in peace, Jorge. We will continue to make great things to inspire others like yourself, and we will always remember you.</span></p>

<p>The Zelda Project is a Los Angeles, CA based group of friends who seek to bring to life the characters, settings, and overall feel of Ocarina of Time through photography and film. Our ultimate goal is to create the characters as they would appear in reality to the best of our abilities, placing them in beautiful sceneries true to their Hyrulean counterparts, and creating elaborate photosets, as well as a film short.</p>
<p>Zelda: Joellen Elam Lillyxandra<br /> Costume: Sarah Quillian Scott Adella<br /> Wig: Sarah Quillian Scott Adella<br /> Photography: Jan-Michael Losada <a href="http://www.jan-michaellosada.com">www.jan-michaellosada.com</a><br /> Makeup/Special FX: Sarah Quillian Scott Adella Joellen Elam Lillyxandra<br /> Custom armor: Aaron Granofsky<br /> Tabard Apron: Chris Patterson<br />Guards: Michael Huffman, Kody Klein, Luciano Gianola</p>

<p>FFFFFFFF this one was as long a time coming as Fire Temple. Joellen and I have been trying to get this shoot done for forever! I'm so stoked it's finally on it's way to your eyes!  I'm not even kidding when I say I have made 3 of these dresses in order to get this right.  The preliminary pattern worked well, but the first dress had ugly fabric so I changed that up, and then the second dress had beautiful fabric but I accidentally cut the keyhole in the front too deep and it fell beneath the armor.  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ AAAAHHH!!!  Third time was a charm!</p>
<p>The dress is lined in poly 70denier, and the shell and overlay are silk taffeta and silk chiffon.  The armor was a custom craft by Aaron Granofsky, and made to fit a duct tape torso of Joellen that he flew back home with in his suitcase.  I'm sure the TSA scratched their heads over that one!  The wig was probably the most fun out of all for me, and those curls in the front looked so good initially, but in 104F/40F heat, it was nearly impossible to keep any real shape to them, but I swear they looked impeccable when we first put it on!  Lastly, Chris Patterson is an embroidery wizard.  He incorporated some fabulous historical techniques to create the beautiful textures and stitching on the apron.  Can't wait to show more photos!  Hope everyone enjoys these in this series.  We plan on shooting a LinkxZelda series pretty soon.  We are working on getting permission from a local church to shoot the Temple of Time/Captured! Scene!</p>
<p>This cosplay photo was a huge combined group effort that was a labor of love by friends and fans of the Legend of Zelda series. Combining all aspects of art from photography to digital editing, we wanted to bring the Legend of Zelda to life as best we could in a final presentation. As always, this has been incredibly rewarding, and we hope that those of you who view our work are brought a little bit more into the world of Hyrule through our art.</p>
<p>A special thanks to everyone who has helped us get this far! Without all of your support and kindness we wouldn't have been able to make this happen. We only hope that with what we produce, a smile is put on your face!</p></div>]]></description>

<p>It had been ten years since the boy in green came to her with a story about a doomed future that they alone could change.  She had given him the Ocarina of Time for safe keeping, a memento of their time together, and watched as he rode away in search of his fairy companion.  On afternoons like this, she wandered the castle gardens, wondering if one day he would return.<br style="color: #2c3635; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;" /><br style="color: #2c3635; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;" />The Zelda Project is a Los Angeles, CA based group of friends who seek to bring to life the characters, settings, and overall feel of Ocarina of Time through photography and film.

Joellen and I have been trying to get this shoot done for forever! I'm so stoked it's finally on it's way to your eyes!  I'm not even kidding when I say I have made 3 of these dresses in order to get this right.  The preliminary pattern worked well, but the first dress had ugly fabric so I changed that up, and then the second dress had beautiful fabric but I accidentally cut the keyhole in the front too deep and it fell beneath the armor.  <br /><br />(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ AAAAHHH!!!  Third time was a charm!<br /><br />The dress is lined in poly 70denier, and the shell and overlay are silk taffeta and silk chiffon.  The armor was a custom craft by Aaron Granofsky, and made to fit a duct tape torso of Joellen that he flew back home with in his suitcase.  I'm sure the TSA scratched their heads over that one!  The wig was probably the most fun out of all for me, and those curls in the front looked so good initially, but in 104F/40F heat, it was nearly impossible to keep any real shape to them, but I swear they looked impeccable when we first put it on!  Lastly, Chris Patterson is an embroidery wizard.  He incorporated some fabulous historical techniques to create the beautiful textures and stitching on the apron.  Can't wait to show more photos!  Hope everyone enjoys these in this series.  We plan on shooting a LinkxZelda series pretty soon.  We are working on getting permission from a local church to shoot the Temple of Time/Captured!

<p>This photo was meant to be the last in the set, but unfortunately the final two that were supposed to go before this one are not ready.  I didn't want to be late again for you guys, so I just posted this.  Sorry they're out of order guys.  :) Expect to see more Link riding Epona in future shoots!</p>
<p>The background is a beautiful digital matte painting by Mickael Forrett.  Also, to answer the popular question about horse makeup:  We painted Big John's legs and tail and ears to have black on them because his coloration wasn't like that.  We used horse show touch-up which many people use in horse shows to hide things like scars and imperfections on their horses.  :D  Think of it kinda like spray in hair color for humans, but it's made for horses.</p>
<p>The Zelda Project is a Los Angeles, CA based group of friends who seek to bring to life the characters, settings, and overall feel of Ocarina of Time through photography and film. Our ultimate goal is to create the characters as they would appear in reality to the best of our abilities, placing them in beautiful sceneries true to their Hyrulean counterparts, and creating elaborate photosets, as well as a film short (coming soon! Stay tuned for our Kickstarter project!).</p>

As I promised in the photo of Link and Malon overlooking Death Mountain, I am posting the detail shot. In the photo description, I included that there were two easter eggs in the painting if you knew your Hyrulean Topography! <br /><br />1. Kakariko Village - While far away, some commenters were successfully able to locate it. Due to the low resolution of the photo, it wasn't easy, but if you were able to see this you successfully found the village! Now for fun, look a little closer and you can see the bridge over the river, the area where you will run up the stairs that are cut into the mountain that lead up to the village, and finally the death mountain trail running out of the village!<br /><br />2. Zora's falls - On the right near Malon's fingers, you can see Zora's falls, and the area where the hidden doorway to the Zora's Domain should be! <br /><br />3. There was actually a third easter egg, however only a few people noticed this! It was really fun to see if anyone noticed it <img src="http://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/w/wink.gif" border="0" alt=";)" title=";) (Wink)" width="15" height="15" /> You can see that the Great Deku Tree grove is within the massive forest to the south east!<br /><br />Hope you guys enjoy this little zoomed-in snippet of <strong>Mickael Forrett</strong>'s matte painting! It was a true pleasure to collaborate and plot these little teeny visual treats for you guys!<br /><br />Love, Sarah</p></div>]]></description>

Our ultimate goal is to create the characters as they would appear in reality to the best of our abilities, placing them in beautiful sceneries true to their Hyrulean counterparts, and creating elaborate photosets, as well as a film short (coming soon! Stay tuned for our Kickstarter project!).<br /><br />Link Model: Anthony (retired from the project)<br />Malon Model: Sarah Quillian <br />Epona Model: Big John<br />Costume: Made by Sarah Quillian<br />Photography: IndigoVerse <br />Matte Painting: Mickael Forrett<br />Leatherworking: Ben Wallace, Sarah Quillian<br />Sword/Shield/Sheath: Aaron Granofsky<br />Navi Effects: Julia Starr<br />Horse Trainer: Dawn Stafford (Stafford Ranch &amp; Stables)<br />Horse Owner: Jerry Rudolph<br />Horse Wrangler: John Sedano<br />Chicken Wrangler: John Sedano, Dawn Stafford<br />On-Site Vet Tech: Marcus Eddings<br />Horse Make-up: Marcus Eddings<br />Assistant Camera: Julia Starr<br />Bowser Pin: Donated by :devanimegeer:<br />Storyboarding: Sofia Alexander<br /><br /><br />Join us on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Zelda-Project/238986233792">FACEBOOK</a><br />Join us on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/zeldaproject">Youtube</a><br />Join us on <a href="https://twitter.com/thezeldaproject">Twitter</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.thezeldaproject.net/2012-02-08-05-29-39/donate">Contribute to the project</a><br /><br />The Malon costume is a classic remake of my original Malon costume.  The skirt, blouse, and scarf are all 100% linen of varying weaves and thicknesses.  The costume has been distressed to show wear and tear, assuming that Malon would get dirty if she was working on the ranch all day!  The background is a beautiful digital matte painting by Mickael Forrett.  Also, to answer the popular question about horse makeup:  We painted Big John's legs and tail and ears to have black on them because his coloration wasn't like that.  We used horse show touch-up which many people use in horse shows to hide things like scars and imperfections on their horses.  :D  Think of it kinda like spray in hair color for humans, but it's made for horses.<br /><br />This cosplay photo was a huge combined group effort that was a labor of love by friends and fans of the Legend of Zelda series. Combining all aspects of art from photography to matte painting, we wanted to bring the Legend of Zelda to life as best we could in a final presentation. So far this has been incredibly rewarding, and we hope that those of you who view our work are brought a little bit more into the world of Hyrule through our art.<br /><br />A special thanks to everyone who has helped us get this far! Without all of your support and kindness we wouldn't have been able to make this happen. We only hope that with what we produce, a smile is put on your face!</p></div>]]></description>
